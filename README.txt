Introduction
============

This package provides integration of the `citationstyles
<http://citationstyles.org/`_ project into the `Plone <http://plone.org>`_
content management system. The package extends the functionality of
`Products.CMFBibliographyAT <http://plone.org/products/cmfbibliographyat/>`.
It provides a control panel where site administrators may configure available
citation styles, abbreviations and localizations. It also provides a set of
views and view macros for bibliographic items allowing content creators to
select the style in which their citations should appear.
